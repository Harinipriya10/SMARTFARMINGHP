Project Overview:
This project presents an interactive Power BI Dashboard built to analyze and monitor smart farming and crop yield performance using real-world agricultural data.
It aims to help farmers, researchers, and stakeholders make data-driven decisions to improve crop productivity, soil health, and risk management.

Dashboard Features:
1. Yield Analysis
Track average and total crop yields across different farm locations.
Visualize yield trends based on sowing and harvest months.
Compare yields across different crop types.
2. Soil and Climate Impact
Analyze how soil moisture, soil pH, NDVI index, and rainfall affect crop yields.
Correlate climatic factors with productivity through scatter plots and heatmaps.
3. Irrigation and Fertilizer Analysis
Understand the impact of irrigation methods and fertilizer types on yield performance.
Discover the most effective farming practices for maximizing output.
4. Disease Monitoring
Monitor the distribution and severity of crop diseases across farms.
Identify high-risk regions using disease heatmaps and KPIs.
5. Time Analysis
Track seasonal patterns of sowing and harvesting activities.
Understand the influence of harvest timing on overall yield.
6. Farm Efficiency Analysis
Measure time-to-harvest efficiency and correlate it with yield results.
Evaluate soil health categories (acidic, neutral, alkaline) and their effect on farm
productivity.
7. Comparative Regional Analysis
Benchmark regional yield performances and disease prevalence.
Identify top-performing and underperforming regions.
 8. Risk Assessment
Calculate farm risk scores based on soil health, disease status, and irrigation type.
Highlight farms needing intervention through risk alerts and scoring visuals.

Tools Used"
Power BI: Data visualization and dashboarding
Python (Pandas, NumPy): Data cleaning and preprocessing
Excel: Initial data exploration
DAX: Advanced measures and calculations for Power BI

Key Measures and Calculations:
Total Yield: Sum of yield per hectare
Average Yield: Mean yield across farms
Farm Count: Total number of distinct farms
Disease Rate: % of farms affected by diseases
Harvest/Sowing Month Trends: Monthly trend analysis
Farm Risk Score: Custom scoring based on farming risks

Getting Started:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Load the cleaned_dataset.csv into Power BI.
3. Open the dashboard.pbix file to explore or customize visuals.
4. MOodify the Python script if re-cleaning or new data preprocessing is needed.(Optional)


Future Enhancements:
Integrate predictive models for yield forecasting (Machine Learning).
Add real-time data streaming for live farm monitoring.
Deploy dashboard to Power BI Service for web-based access and sharing.


Happy Farming with Data!
